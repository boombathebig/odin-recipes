    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A succulent dish.  The fabled Gordon Ramsey came down from upon his mountain
        top to teach us mere mortals the way of the mast chef in true Promethian fashion.
    </p>
    <p>Let out your <em>inner caveman</em> and howl at the moon as you tear into the flesh
    of this delicious bovine.  Perfect seasoning... which means not much at all.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) 2-inch thick porterhouse steak, at room temperature</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup hickory wood chips, soaked</li>
        <li>olive oil </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season steak generously with salt and black pepper on both sides.</li>
                
        <li>Place wood chips in the smoker box of your gas grill according to 
            manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        
        
        <li>Preheat one side of the grill to about 250 degrees F (121 degrees C).</li>
        Step 4
        
        <li>Place steak on the cool side of the grill. Cook until an instant-read
             thermometer inserted into the center reads about 100 degrees F (37 degrees
              C), 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer steak to a plate. Brush with olive oil a
              nd cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        
        
        <li>Increase heat on the grill to 600 degrees F (315 degrees C) by turning both 
            burners up to maximum.</li>
        Step 6
        
        <li>Cook steak until crust forms and an instant-read thermometer inserted into
             the center reads 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), about 3 minutes per side. 
             Transfer steak back to plate. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest before 
             serving, about 5 minutes.</li>
